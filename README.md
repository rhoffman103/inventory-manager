# Inventory Manager

Inventory Manager is a mockup for a specialized manufacturing process. The MVP will allow Admin(s) to be able to create work orders and view progess from production. The production floor will have a simple UI to add product as it is produced, track the progress and leave notes per shift.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The electron.js enviornment was recreated by these steps [elecron and cra](https://medium.com/@kitze/%EF%B8%8F-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3)
